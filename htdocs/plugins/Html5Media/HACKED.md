Note that this plugin has been modified to add custom options to the mediaplayer object.

Also modified to store settings in mejs-options rather than appending a script tag to each player.

Currently hoping to merge this functionality back into the main plugin code, see https://github.com/zerocrates/Html5Media/issues/9.
