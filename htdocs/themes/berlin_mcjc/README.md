# MCJC Berlin Theme

Originally created by Anne Tomasevich, 2017.

## Local dev set-up - With docker
Running `make up` will automatically start a [compass container](https://github.com/stevevega/docker-compass) to watch & compile 
scss files. This should "just work". Note that the config.rb file in the `sass` directory controls this
build process. Do not edit this file.

## Local dev set-up - Manual

With bundler installed, from this directory run `bundle install`. 
Then run `bundle exec compass watch` to regenerate css on the fly
and `bundle exec compass compile` to compile. You'll need to commit
changes to compiled CSS alongside SCSS changes, unfortunately.
